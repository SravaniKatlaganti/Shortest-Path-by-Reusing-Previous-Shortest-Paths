# Shortest-Path-in-a-Network

## Shortest Path by Adaptive Approach
Make use of a network that mimics a real-world environment such as road network or a computer network. Both types of environments are dynamic with time varying traffic and the goal is to adapt to varying traffic levels. Python code that implements the working of an agent which adapts to changing traffic conditions and returns the shortest path from a given starting location to a destination. For this used an adaptive approach to modify the shortest path that was computed such that the new route reuses some of the edges from the old route and this improves efficiency.
